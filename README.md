Quick little Redux practice project.

The program uses mock data from a JSON array of questions, answers, and number of times the answer was selected (answer vote). The simple program picks one question at random and displays the question prompt with it's potential answers.

Once a user makes a selection, the JSON file is updated and the answer vote is incremented by one.
 
Redux is used to to handle state throughout the program.
